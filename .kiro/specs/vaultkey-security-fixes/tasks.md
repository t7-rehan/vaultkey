# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Write bug condition exploration tests (BEFORE any fixes)
  - **Property 1: Bug Condition** - All 5 Security Issues Exposed on Unfixed Code
  - **CRITICAL**: These tests MUST FAIL (or confirm defects) on unfixed code — failure confirms each bug exists
  - **DO NOT attempt to fix the tests or the code when they fail**
  - **GOAL**: Surface concrete counterexamples that demonstrate every bug exists
  - **Scoped PBT Approach**: Scope each property to the concrete failing case(s) to ensure reproducibility

  Explore Issue 2 — CORS Wildcard:
  - Inspect the `origins` list in `main.py` and assert `"*"` is present
  - Send a credentialed request from `http://evil.example.com` and verify it receives `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers
  - Document counterexample: requests from arbitrary origins succeed because `"*"` is in the list
  - _isBugCondition_2: "*" IN origins_list_

  Explore Issue 3 — No Rate Limiting on Public Access Endpoints:
  - Send 20 consecutive `POST /api/access/{token}/authorize` requests from the same IP
  - Verify all 20 return 401 (wrong password) rather than 429 after the 5th
  - Send 20 consecutive `POST /api/access/{token}/download` requests from the same IP
  - Verify all 20 are processed without a 429
  - Document counterexample: unlimited requests reach the route handler with no throttling
  - _isBugCondition_3: no_rate_limit_on_endpoint AND request_count_in_window > 5_

  Explore Issue 5 — No File-Content Validation Before Encryption:
  - Create a JPEG file (bytes start with `FFD8FF`) and rename it to `.pdf`
  - Call `encryptFile(renamedJpeg)` and verify it returns `{ encryptedBlob, ivHex, keyHex }` without error
  - Create a `.txt` file containing a null byte (`0x00`) and call `encryptFile(nullByteTxt)`; verify it proceeds without error
  - Document counterexamples: non-PDF content and malformed text are encrypted without any rejection
  - _isBugCondition_5: (isBinaryExtension(ext) AND NOT matchesMagicBytes(bytes, ext)) OR (isTextExtension(ext) AND containsNullBytes(bytes))_

  Explore Issue 8 — Missing Audit Log Entries on Revoked/Expired Downloads:
  - Create a revoked share link; call `POST /api/access/{token}/download`
  - Query the `access_logs` table; verify no `ACCESS_DENIED` record was written for this request
  - Create an expired share link; call `POST /api/access/{token}/download`
  - Query the `access_logs` table; verify no `LINK_EXPIRED` record was written for this request
  - Document counterexamples: revoked and expired download attempts leave no audit trail
  - _isBugCondition_8: share.revoked=true OR share.expired=true AND no AccessLog written for download_

  Explore Issue 11 — schema.sql Out of Sync:
  - Apply `database/schema.sql` to a fresh database
  - Verify the `users` table `email` column has `NOT NULL` (matches models.py — this is OK)
  - Verify the `access_logs` table does NOT have a `FILE_VIEWED` entry in any constraint (schema.sql comment says `FILE_VIEWED` but the model includes it — check for drift)
  - Compare each table column set in `schema.sql` against the SQLAlchemy models in `models.py`
  - Document any column or constraint that differs between schema.sql and the live model definitions
  - _isBugCondition_11: schemaSQL.column_definitions != models.column_definitions for any table_

  - Run all exploration checks on UNFIXED code
  - **EXPECTED OUTCOME**: All 5 defects confirmed; document each counterexample found
  - Mark task complete when all checks are written, run, and failures/defects are documented
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2 (Issue 2); 1.1, 1.2 (Issue 3); 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 (Issue 5); 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 (Issue 8); 1.1, 1.2 (Issue 11)_

- [x] 2. Write preservation property tests (BEFORE implementing any fix)
  - **Property 2: Preservation** - All Existing Correct Behaviors Captured on Unfixed Code
  - **IMPORTANT**: Follow observation-first methodology — run UNFIXED code, observe outputs, then codify them
  - **GOAL**: Establish a regression baseline that all fixes must satisfy

  Observe and encode preservation for CORS allowed origins (Issue 2 — 3.1, 3.2):
  - With `origins` list containing `"http://localhost:5173"`, send a request from that origin
  - Observe: response contains `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:5173` header
  - Observe: `X-IV-Hex` and `X-Original-Filename` are in `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`
  - Write property: for all origins in the configured allow-list, CORS headers are present and expose-headers are intact
  - Verify these properties PASS on unfixed code

  Observe and encode preservation for within-limit requests (Issue 3 — 3.1, 3.2):
  - Send 5 requests to `POST /api/access/{token}/authorize` from the same IP with a wrong password
  - Observe: all 5 return 401 (not 429) — within-limit behaviour preserved
  - Send 5 requests to `POST /api/access/{token}/download` from the same IP
  - Observe: all 5 are processed normally (no 429)
  - Observe: `GET /api/access/{token}` is NOT affected by POST-route rate limits
  - Write property: for all request counts ≤ 5 within 60s, the response is never HTTP 429

  Observe and encode preservation for valid file encryption (Issue 5 — 3.1, 3.2, 3.3):
  - Call `encryptFile(validPdf)` where the file starts with `%PDF` bytes
  - Observe: returns `{ encryptedBlob, ivHex, keyHex }` without error
  - Call `encryptFile(validPng)` where the file starts with `\x89PNG` bytes
  - Observe: returns result without error
  - Call `encryptFile(validTxt)` where the file contains no null bytes
  - Observe: returns result without error
  - Write property-based test: for all files whose bytes match their declared extension, `encryptFile` always succeeds

  Observe and encode preservation for existing audit log entries (Issue 8 — 3.1, 3.2):
  - Trigger `ACCESS_ATTEMPT` (via `GET /api/access/{token}`), `ACCESS_GRANTED`, `PASSWORD_FAILED`, `FILE_DOWNLOADED`, `FILE_VIEWED`, `ACCESS_DENIED` (via download limit reached) events
  - Query `access_logs` after each; verify every record has non-null `share_id`, `file_id`, `owner_id`, `event`, `status`, `user_agent`, `ip_address`
  - Write property: for all event types already logged, AccessLog records are complete with all required fields

  Observe and encode preservation for schema.sql sync (Issue 11 — 3.1, 3.2):
  - Start the application with `Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)` and verify no errors
  - Verify `create_all` is a no-op on a database where tables already exist (no DROP, no ALTER)
  - Document which tables and columns the live models define (baseline for schema.sql comparison)

  - Run all preservation tests on UNFIXED code
  - **EXPECTED OUTCOME**: All preservation tests PASS (establishes baseline to protect)
  - Mark task complete when all tests are written, run, and passing on unfixed code
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2 (Issue 2); 3.1, 3.2 (Issue 3); 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 (Issue 5); 3.1, 3.2 (Issue 8); 3.1, 3.2 (Issue 11)_

    - Confirm the `TEXT_EXTENSIONS` set covers `txt`, `md`, `json`, `js`, `py`, `html`, `css`, `csv`, `log`
    - Confirm the `validateFileContent(file, buffer)` function:
      - For binary extensions: slices `buffer` at the magic-byte offset and compares the hex prefix; throws a descriptive `Error` on mismatch
      - For text extensions: scans for null bytes (`0x00`) and throws a descriptive `Error` if found
      - Is called with `(file, fileBuffer)` after `file.arrayBuffer()` resolves and BEFORE `generateKey` is called
    - _Bug_Condition: isBugCondition_5(file) — isBinaryExt AND NOT matchesMagicBytes OR isTextExt AND containsNullBytes_
    - _Expected_Behavior: Error thrown with descriptive message before any crypto operations for invalid files_
